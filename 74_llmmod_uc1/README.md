        Use Pydantic to structure the output with fields like title, authors, abstract, and main findings.
        Make a yes-no decision: Use an LLM to decide whether a paper should be included in the literature review based on relevance (e.g., does it align with your research question?).
        Loop: If the paper isn’t relevant, continue scraping additional articles and performing the same analysis until a sufficient number of papers are included.

5. Legal Document Review Automation

    Use Case: Automate the review of legal documents to identify clauses or issues in contracts.
    Workflow:
        Google search for legal templates or contract samples.
        Load webpages with legal documents as Langchain documents.
        Extract key contract clauses (e.g., termination clause, indemnity clause, etc.).
        Use Pydantic to structure the output with fields such as clause type, clause text, and potential issues.
        Make a yes-no decision: Use an LLM to identify whether a clause is problematic or needs modification (e.g., "Is this termination clause unfavorable to our client?").
        Loop: If a problematic clause is found, highlight it and repeat the review for the next section or document until all issues are identified.

6. Investment Opportunity Screening

    Use Case: Create a system that scans financial websites for potential investment opportunities in companies or stocks.
    Workflow:
        Google search for news articles, blogs, or financial reports related to specific sectors or companies.
        Load webpages containing financial news, company profiles, or stock analyses as Langchain documents.
        Extract critical financial information like stock prices, growth trends, and analyst recommendations.
        Use Pydantic to structure the output with fields like company name, stock price, market trend, and investment rating.
        Make a yes-no decision: Use an LLM to determine whether a stock is worth considering based on specific financial metrics (e.g., "Does the company show a strong revenue growth trajectory?").
        Loop: If the stock isn’t suitable, continue searching for more companies or financial articles until a list of investment candidates is compiled.

7. Travel Destination Recommendation System

    Use Case: Build a system that recommends travel destinations based on user preferences and recent travel articles.
    Workflow:
        Google search for travel blogs, review sites, or news articles about popular travel destinations.
        Load webpages containing travel destination descriptions, reviews, or travel tips as Langchain documents.
        Extract key information such as location, attractions, weather, and travel costs.
        Use Pydantic to structure the output with fields like destination name, top attractions, best time to visit, and estimated cost.
        Make a yes-no decision: Use an LLM to decide if a destination matches the user’s preferences (e.g., "Does this location have beaches and warm weather?").
        Loop: If the destination isn’t a match, continue searching and analyzing more webpages until a set of recommendations is found.

8. Automated FAQ Generation for E-commerce Websites
